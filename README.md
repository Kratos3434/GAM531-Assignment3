•	When Z is pressed key in the keyboard, one of the shapes should disappear. The shape that disappears should be random. 

•	When T is pressed in the keyboard, the remaining shape should rotate by 35 degrees, clockwise on the Z axis.

•	When O is pressed in the keyboard, the remaining shape should start moving left to -1.0 in the x axis and then stop and move right to 1.0 in the x axis.

•	When Q is pressed, all transformations should be erased and both shapes should appear back to their original coordinates.

•	If the user presses M, then the game (application) should exit.

•	The game will be rendered to a window with dimensions 800x600.

•	The viewer’s point of view won’t change. All the objects will be rendered in a Top-Down perspective.

•	In the Viewport add 2 umbrella-like shapes should be rendered using Vertex Data (not external models), with 0.20 dimension in all sides. Each one next to each other at x = 0.5, y = 0.5 in normalized scene coordinates.

•	Use Index Rendering for all primitives.
